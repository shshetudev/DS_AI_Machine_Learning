- Python is a programming language widely used by Data Scientists.
- Python has in-built mathematical libraries and functions, making it easier to calculate mathematical problems and to perform data analysis.

## Python libraries
- Python has libraries with large collections of mathematical functions and analytical tools.
- For example:
  - **Pandas** - This library is used for structured data operations, like import CSV files, create dataframes, and data preparation
  - **Numpy** - This is a mathematical library. Has a powerful N-dimensional array object, linear algebra, Fourier transform, etc.
  - **Matplotlib** - This library is used for visualization of data.
  - **SciPy** - This library has linear algebra modules
