## What is Data Science?
- **Data gathering, analysis and decision-making:**
  - Data Science is about data gathering, analysis and decision-making.
- **Finding patterns and future predictions:**
  - Data Science is about finding patterns in data, through analysis, and make future predictions.
- **Combination of multiple disciplines:**
  - It is a combination of multiple disciplines that uses statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data and to extract knowledge and insights from it.
- **Companies are growing:**
  - By using Data Science, companies are able to make:
    - Better decisions (should we choose A or B).
    - Predictive analysis (what will happen next?).
    - Pattern discoveries (find pattern, or maybe hidden information in the data).

## Where is Data Science Needed?
- DS is need in many industries e.g. banking, consultancy, healthcare and manufacturing.
- For example:
  - **For route planning**: To discover the best routes to ship
  - **To foresee delays** for flight/ship/train etc. (through predictive analysis)
  - **To create promotional offers**
  - **To find the best suited time to deliver goods**
  - **To forecast the next years revenue for a company**
  - **To analyze health benefit of training**
  - **To predict who will win elections**

## Expertise requires for a Data Scientist
- A data scientist requires expertise in several backgrounds:
  - Machine Learning
  - Statistics
  - Programming (Python or R)
  - Mathematics
  - Databases
- A data scientist must find patterns within the data. Before finding the patterns, he/she must organize the data is a standard format.

## How does a data scientist work?
1. **Ask the right questions:** To understand the business problem.
2. **Explore and collect data:** From database, web logs, customer feedback etc.
3. **Extract the data:** Transform the data to standardized format.
4. **Clean the data:** Remove erroneous values from the data.
5. **Find and replace missing values:** Check for missing values and replace them with a suitable valuev(e.g. an average value).
6. **Normalize data:** Scale the values in a parctical range (e.g. 140 cm is smaller than 1.8 m. However, the number 140 is larger than 1.8 - so scalling is important).
7. **Analyze data, find patterns and make future predictions.**
8. **Represent the result:** Present the result with useful insights in a way the "company" can understand.
